            </header>
            <p>As I am making this website, I am going into my senior year of college, which means that this is when most of the pressure is going to fall on me. I have to worry about getting a job which in this job market is a hard enough task as is. That, paired with my lack of experience, has worried me and made me doubt my future. However, that does not mean that I can't attempt to find a decent job that pertains to the career I want.</p>

            <h3>Codepath Web Dev Student (JS, HTML, CSS)</h3>
            <p>Even though this is not an internship, this opportunity taught me a lot about building and managing websites. The project that we worked on throughout the duration of the class was an advocacy website that aims to spread information about a certain ongoing topic. I chose to talk about ongoing famines across the globe and discussed how these famines started, the help the people are getting, and whether or not progress has been made towards securing a future for the people suffering through it every day all over the world.</p>

                <h3>Breast Cancer Detection (Big Data Class Project)</h3>
                <p>This project uses the <i>Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset</i> to determine if a mass is benign or malignant using the scikit-learn library to train and test using multiple methods. The first method was the decision tree classifier, which is just training the model using the testing data and presenting it in a tree format. In the next part, we used a random forest map-reduce ensemble, which similarly to part one, trained 3 different trees of depths 3, 5, and 7 at once using multicore processing, then combined them using a majority vote and presented that tree as well as time, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.</p>
                <p>In the final 2 parts, we trained the dataset on a support vector machine using the RBF, linear, and polynomial classifiers at once using multicore processing, then like the past parts combined them and presented the data as well as scatter plots of all 3 classifiers and the combined one. Finally, all of this data was used to predict if a mass is benign or malignant using any 2 features.</p>

                <h3>SKAM (WIP)</h3>
                <p>With just a tap of your phone with a friend (or search), you can share all your personal, work, or student information at once. Instantly get your new friend's name, phone number, emails, socials, and more on a virtual business card. No more asking them for each handle. Start up a conversation with your new acquaintance, get to know them more. You can choose how much you want to share with someone by simply choosing from the options student, work, and personal. Each of them contains specific socials and contact information depending on the environment that you met your new friend at.</p>
                <p>This project was made with 3 other people, we used Firebase, React Native, and Expo.</p>

            <h2>Additional Info</h2>
            <p>When it comes to languages, I've used a couple: C++, HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, NoSQL. I would definitely say that I am most comfortable with Python as well as the front-end languages right now mostly because I have been using them very often for multiple months straight. I also have decent experience with C++ due to my classes using it. Right now, with the app I'm making with my friends (SKAM), it was a learning curve, but I realized that it's very similar to the other languages that I've been using and I am slowly getting more comfortable with TSX.</p>
